    "[analysis by Nesta](http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/using-meetup-data-explore-uk-digital-tech-landscape), which focussed on tech-related meetings, has shown how it is possible to analyse their geography, and how the group creation trends can be linked to the emergence of new technologies.\n",

    "I then collected the 200 most-populated cities and towns in the UK and in the world. I also collected meetup groups in the UK and event information, obtaining a dataset of 13844 groups, of which 1559 are tech-related and others belong to one of the following categories:\n",

    "\n",
    "The first question of this analysis is: how are members of Meetup distributed among cities? This question is very important because all analysis based on Meetup data will be influenced by geographic biases. If Meetup is vastly more popular in a city than in another, for example because users prefer a competing service like Eventbrite, this will affect geographic analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the plot below I show the number of Meetup users in a city versus the city population, in log-log scale, for the 200 most popular cities in Meetup. The plot highlights in green the top 10 cities, mostly based in the United States, and in orange the UK cities present in the list.\n",

    "\n",
    "The plot shows a very weak relation between a city population and the number of Meetup users. The top 10 cities show very high number of members, even if their city population greatly varies within 2 orders of magnitude. Also UK cities show great variability in the number of members, with London vastly dominating and other cities showing a markedly lower number of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be interesting to continue in this direction and understand what drives Meetup popularity, for example investigating for example whether a [Network Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) influences user adoption of the platform."

This result suggests that tech events are very much treated as work-related, as not many events are organised outside working days, whereas non-tech events do not show this phenomenon as markedly. \n",

    "- Tech meetings have different properties than non-tech-related events, both in terms of spatial distribution and temporal patterns.\n",
    "- Tech meetings are held in proximity of tech hubs, and at end of workdays. The low number of meetings during weekends and holidays, especially compared to non-tech events, suggests that attenders regard such events as work-related.\n",
